Trying to get this website going, using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) as the editor, using the [Digitial Garden](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden) plugin.

The content is hosted on [github](https://github.com/JakeJasko/nebulous.space) and then deployed for free with [Vercel](https://vercel.app), pretty neat.

Let's get a [[First Post\|First Post]] going with a link to see if that works.
